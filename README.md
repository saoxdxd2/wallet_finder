## Installation

There are two main ways to install/run the Crypto Wallet Scanner:

**1. Using PyInstaller Build (Recommended for Windows Users / Simplicity)**

This method uses a pre-built executable (if provided by developers) or allows you to build one using PyInstaller.

*   **Build the Executable (if not provided):**
    1.  Ensure Python 3.9+ and `pip` are installed.
    2.  Install PyInstaller: `pip install pyinstaller`
    3.  Install project dependencies: `pip install -r finder/requirements.txt`
    4.  Navigate to the project root directory in your terminal.
    5.  Run PyInstaller using the spec file: `pyinstaller CryptoWalletScanner.spec`
        *   This will create a `dist/CryptoWalletScanner` folder (one-dir build) or a `dist/CryptoWalletScanner.exe` (one-file build, if spec is modified for it).
*   **Windows Installation (`install.bat`):**
    1.  After building with PyInstaller (or if an executable is provided in `dist/`), run `install.bat` from the project root.
    2.  This script will:
        *   Ask for an installation location (defaults to user's AppData).
        *   Copy the built application to the chosen location.
        *   Create Desktop and Start Menu shortcuts.
    3.  You can then launch the application from these shortcuts.
*   **Linux/macOS (Manual for PyInstaller build):**
    1.  Build using PyInstaller as described above.
    2.  The output will be in the `dist/` folder. You can run the executable directly from `dist/CryptoWalletScanner/CryptoWalletScanner` (for one-dir) or `dist/CryptoWalletScanner` (for one-file).
    3.  You may need to `chmod +x` the executable.
    4.  Manually create shortcuts or move the `dist/CryptoWalletScanner` folder to a preferred location (e.g., `/opt` or `~/Applications`).

**2. Running from Source (Recommended for Linux Developers / Customization)**

This method involves setting up a Python virtual environment and running the application scripts directly.

*   **Prerequisites:**
    *   Python 3.9+
    *   `pip` (Python package installer)
    *   `python3-venv` (or equivalent for your Python distribution, e.g., `python3.9-venv`)
*   **Linux Installation (`finder/install_linux.sh`):**
    1.  Navigate to the `finder` directory: `cd finder`
    2.  Make the script executable: `chmod +x install_linux.sh`
    3.  Run the installer: `./install_linux.sh`
    4.  The script will:
        *   Check for dependencies.
        *   Ask for installation locations (defaults to `~/.local/share/CryptoWalletScanner` for app files and `~/.local/bin` for the launcher).
        *   Create a Python virtual environment.
        *   Install required Python packages into the venv.
        *   Create a launcher script (default: `cryptowalletscanner`) in your chosen binary directory.
        *   Optionally create a `.desktop` file for application menus.
    5.  If `~/.local/bin` (or your chosen bin directory) is in your PATH, you can then run `cryptowalletscanner` from any terminal. Otherwise, run the full path to the launcher.
*   **Windows/macOS (Manual Source Setup):**
    1.  Ensure Python 3.9+ and `pip` are installed.
    2.  Create a virtual environment: `python3 -m venv venv`
    3.  Activate the virtual environment:
        *   Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
        *   Linux/macOS: `source venv/bin/activate`
    4.  Install dependencies: `pip install -r finder/requirements.txt`
    5.  Run the application: `python finder/app2.py`

## Requirements
Component	Minimum Version
Python	3.9+ (compatible with PyTorch and PySide6)
RAM	4 GB (8GB+ recommended for AI features and smoother GUI)
Storage	100 MB (more if DQN models become large or many logs are kept)
CPU	Multi-core CPU recommended

## Dependencies
Python Packages:
  - `PySide6` (for the graphical user interface)
  - `torch` (PyTorch for DQN agents)
  - `aiohttp` (for asynchronous HTTP requests)
  - `aiolimiter` (for rate limiting async operations)
  - `bip-utils` (for BIP39 mnemonic and BIP44 address derivation)
  - `mnemonic` (for BIP39 mnemonic generation)
  - (See `finder/requirements.txt` for specific versions and other minor dependencies)

To install Python dependencies manually (if not using installer scripts):
```bash
# (Activate your virtual environment first if using one)
pip install -r finder/requirements.txt
```

## Usage

*   **If installed via `install.bat` (Windows):** Use the Desktop or Start Menu shortcut.
*   **If installed via `finder/install_linux.sh` (Linux):** Run the command `cryptowalletscanner` in your terminal (if the launcher directory is in your PATH) or click the application menu icon if created.
*   **If running from source manually:**
    1.  Activate your Python virtual environment.
    2.  Navigate to the project root directory.
    3.  Run `python finder/app2.py`.

The application GUI (`finder/app2.py`) launches the backend logic (`finder/app.py`) as a separate process.
DQN models for rate limiting and worker count adjustment are stored in `finder/models/` relative to where `finder/app.py` is executed. Logs and state files are also typically stored in the `finder` directory.

Configuration

- **API Endpoints**: Can be adjusted in `finder/app.py` within the `API_ENDPOINTS` dictionary.
- **DQN Parameters**: Hyperparameters for the DQN agents (e.g., learning rate, buffer size, network architecture) are defined in `finder/dqn_agent.py` and `finder/app.py` (for state/action sizes, cycle intervals). These may require tuning for optimal performance. Model checkpoints are saved in `finder/models/`.
- **Mnemonic Generator State**: The `finder/generator_state.txt` file stores the last processed mnemonic index, allowing generation to resume. Deleting this file will restart generation from the beginning.
- **Logging**: Application logs, including DQN decisions and API statistics, are output to standard output and can be observed via the GUI's log panel. Wallet check results are in `finder/checked.txt`.

Adjust API endpoints in app.py:
