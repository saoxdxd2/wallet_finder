![GUI Screenshot](https://via.placeholder.com/800x500.png?text=Crypto+Scanner+GUI+Preview)

A cross-platform tool for generating and checking cryptocurrency wallet balances with real-time monitoring GUI.

## Features

- üöÄ **High-Performance Generation**
  - Python-based multi-process BIP39 mnemonic generation using `multiprocessing`.
  - State preservation for mnemonic generation index.
- üß† **AI-Enhanced Operation (Experimental)**
  - **PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) Agents:** Both API rate limits and the number of concurrent wallet processing workers are now dynamically adjusted by PPO agents for potentially more stable and efficient learning. (Replaced DQNs).
  - Heuristic-based performance tracking for individual API endpoints (scores logged).
  - (Experimental) Initial framework for ML classification of mnemonics/addresses based on on-chain history (includes feature extraction and model training scripts in `analysis/`).
- üì° **Advanced Wallet Processing**
  - **Child Address Derivation:** Checks multiple derived child addresses (e.g., first 10) per mnemonic for each supported coin, significantly increasing coverage.
- üîç **Expanded Blockchain Scanning**
  - Supports **Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), USDT (ERC20), Litecoin (LTC), and Dogecoin (DOGE)**.
  - Each address checked for both balance and on-chain transaction history (existence).
  - Multiple API endpoint fallbacks with performance tracking.
  - AI-controlled request throttling.
- üñ•Ô∏è **Modernized GUI (PySide6 Foundation with React UI Conceptualized)**
  - Backend API (`finder/app.py`) now includes a WebSocket and HTTP server to stream data to a modern UI.
  - The primary GUI (`finder/app2.py`) is now built on PySide6, providing a native desktop experience.
  - Conceptual React components (`frontend/src/`) provided as a template for a potential future web-based UI, capable of displaying detailed child address info, logs, and stats, with basic pause/resume controls.
  - Ethical use disclaimer prompt at GUI startup.
- üõ°Ô∏è **Robustness & Security (Basic)**
  - Optional proxy support (SOCKS5/HTTP) for API requests, configurable in `finder/config.py`.
- üìä **Real-Time GUI Monitoring** (via PySide6 GUI or future React UI)
  - Live updates of checked wallets, including details for multiple child addresses.
  - Display of operational statistics.
  - Log viewing.
- üîí **Safety Features**
  - Local data storage for models, logs, and state.
  - Clean shutdown handling for backend processes.

## Installation

There are two main ways to install/run the Crypto Wallet Scanner:

**1. Using PyInstaller Build (Recommended for Windows Users / Simplicity)**

This method uses a pre-built executable (if provided by developers) or allows you to build one using PyInstaller.

*   **Build the Executable (if not provided):**
    1.  Ensure Python 3.9+ and `pip` are installed.
    2.  Install PyInstaller: `pip install pyinstaller`
    3.  Install project dependencies: `pip install -r finder/requirements.txt`
    4.  Navigate to the project root directory in your terminal.
    5.  Run PyInstaller using the spec file: `pyinstaller CryptoWalletScanner.spec`
        *   This will create a `dist/CryptoWalletScanner` folder (one-dir build) or a `dist/CryptoWalletScanner.exe` (one-file build, if spec is modified for it).
*   **Windows Installation (`install.bat`):**
    1.  After building with PyInstaller (or if an executable is provided in `dist/`), run `install.bat` from the project root.
    2.  This script will:
        *   Ask for an installation location (defaults to user's AppData).
        *   Copy the built application to the chosen location.
        *   Create Desktop and Start Menu shortcuts.
    3.  You can then launch the application from these shortcuts.
*   **Linux/macOS (Manual for PyInstaller build):**
    1.  Build using PyInstaller as described above.
    2.  The output will be in the `dist/` folder. You can run the executable directly from `dist/CryptoWalletScanner/CryptoWalletScanner` (for one-dir) or `dist/CryptoWalletScanner` (for one-file).
    3.  You may need to `chmod +x` the executable.
    4.  Manually create shortcuts or move the `dist/CryptoWalletScanner` folder to a preferred location (e.g., `/opt` or `~/Applications`).

**2. Running from Source (Recommended for Linux Developers / Customization)**

This method involves setting up a Python virtual environment and running the application scripts directly.

*   **Prerequisites:**
    *   Python 3.9+
    *   `pip` (Python package installer)
    *   `python3-venv` (or equivalent for your Python distribution, e.g., `python3.9-venv`)
*   **Linux Installation (`finder/install_linux.sh`):**
    1.  Navigate to the `finder` directory: `cd finder`
    2.  Make the script executable: `chmod +x install_linux.sh`
    3.  Run the installer: `./install_linux.sh`
    4.  The script will:
        *   Check for dependencies.
        *   Ask for installation locations (defaults to `~/.local/share/CryptoWalletScanner` for app files and `~/.local/bin` for the launcher).
        *   Create a Python virtual environment.
        *   Install required Python packages into the venv.
        *   Create a launcher script (default: `cryptowalletscanner`) in your chosen binary directory.
        *   Optionally create a `.desktop` file for application menus.
    5.  If `~/.local/bin` (or your chosen bin directory) is in your PATH, you can then run `cryptowalletscanner` from any terminal. Otherwise, run the full path to the launcher.
*   **Windows/macOS (Manual Source Setup):**
    1.  Ensure Python 3.9+ and `pip` are installed.
    2.  Create a virtual environment: `python3 -m venv venv`
    3.  Activate the virtual environment:
        *   Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
        *   Linux/macOS: `source venv/bin/activate`
    4.  Install dependencies: `pip install -r finder/requirements.txt`
    5.  Run the application: `python finder/app2.py`

Configuration

- **All major configurations are now centralized in `finder/config.py`**. This includes:
    - Paths for logs, models, and state files.
    - API endpoint URLs, keys (placeholders), and parsing hints.
    - PPO agent hyperparameters (learning rates, network sizes, cycle intervals, reward parameters, etc.).
    - Mnemonic generation settings (strength, language, worker counts).
    - Application performance settings (queue sizes, thread pool sizes).
    - Logging levels and log rotation settings.
- **PPO Agent Models**: Trained models are saved in `finder/models/` (e.g., `rate_limiter_ppo_agent.zip`). Deleting these will cause agents to start training from scratch.
- **State Files**:
    - `finder/logs/application_processed_mnemonic_state.txt`: Stores the index of the last mnemonic processed by the application, allowing resumption.
    - `finder/logs/mnemonic_generator_raw_state.txt`: (If used by specific generator features) stores raw generation index.
- **Logging**: All logs are now managed by `finder/logger_setup.py` and stored in `finder/logs/`.
    - `app_main.log` contains general application status, PPO decisions, and errors.
    - `checked_wallets.jsonl` and `found_wallets.jsonl` store detailed records of wallet checks.

Adjust API endpoints and other parameters directly in `finder/config.py`.
